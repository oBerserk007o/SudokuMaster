# SudokuMaster
Initially designed to be an algorithm to solve sudoku boards of various difficulties, this project ended up an inefficient piece of unfinished junk, but that's how we learn, by failing and trying again. 
The code is still functioning, you can play sudoku, but it's missing core features such as verifying the board for errors when you validate it or actually being able to solve a sudoku board.
I got tired and decided to work on other projects, I may return to this idea later and redo it better, but it won't be soon.
